# Database Design

For my final project in Information Representation, I created a college basketball relational database. I also created queries, triggers, and views for my database. As an add-on for my Honors portion, I implemented JSON into my database, which allowed for some more flexibility in my tables.

The SQL file contains the SQL to create my database, while the .txt file contains example queries, views, and triggers for my database.
